# Relationship Wrapped

A small React + Tailwind app to celebrate your relationship. This scaffold includes:

- Days together counter (calculated from `public/relationship.json`).
- Wrapped-style sections: Trips, Inside jokes, Songs.
- Photo carousel (simple slideshow).
- Framer Motion animations for cards.
- Confetti trigger on load using `canvas-confetti`.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Angelo\Desktop\Projects\Anniv"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed local address in your browser.

Next steps: customize `public/relationship.json` with your real data and replace placeholder photos.
